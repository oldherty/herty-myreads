# MyReads Project

This the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. A simple app for sorting book titles, it has three shelves between which you can move books. You can also search for additional books and add them to whatever shelf you wish.

## Installation

To run this app on your local machine in development mode:

* Clone the repository to your local directory and cd to it
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) as well as a select dropdown on the search page. That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
